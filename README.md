# Temperature_Converter_Software

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed and submitted my internship task for Prodigy Infotech! ðŸŽ‰

The task was to create a Python script that converts a given temperature between Celsius (Â°C), Fahrenheit (Â°F), and Kelvin (K). The script includes:

Functions for all possible temperature conversions.
A user input prompt for the temperature value and its unit.
Accurate conversions and display of the temperature in the other two units based on the input.
Error handling for invalid unit inputs to ensure a smooth user experience.
Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to work on this and enhance my skills in Python programming. Looking forward to the next challenges ahead!
